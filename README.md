Game Project - 
In this project I wanted to do a Flappy Bird style game. I used the CSS animation method to move the thorn divs aross the screen. Once we go over to the JS file, I used DOM methods to achieve the outcome of my game. Inside the JS file, if statements that use math comparision connected the positions from my CSS file and JS file. 

You can access my game using https://daniellematthews.github.io/FlutterFly.github.io/ link.

Game Instructions: 
The objective of the game is to avoid the thorns and the toxic purple mist surrounding the thorns. 
Press any key to jump.

Problems To Fix:
The gap in the thorns remain in one position throughout the entire game. Need to make gaps randomly generate.
